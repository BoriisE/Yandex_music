**Project Description**
The comparison between Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths:
Moscow is a metropolis governed by the strict rhythm of the workweek;
St. Petersburg is a city of unique culture, unlike Moscow.
Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Businesses need to distinguish the former from the latter to make rational decisions. Using real data from Yandex Music, you will test hypotheses and compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.

**Hypotheses**

* User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, this manifests differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
* On Monday morning, different music genres dominate in Moscow compared to St. Petersburg. The same applies to Friday evening.
* Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different music genres. Pop music is more often listened to in Moscow, while Russian rap is more popular in St. Petersburg.

**Data**
The data is stored in the file `yandex_music_data.csv`. On the platform, it is located at `/datasets/yandex_music_data.csv`. You can download the dataset to work with it outside the project here.

**Column descriptions:**

* `userID` — user identifier;
* `Track` — track title;
* `artist` — artist name;
* `genre` — genre name;
* `City` — user’s city;
* `time` — listening start time;
* `Day` — day of the week.
